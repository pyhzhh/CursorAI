# 🚀 Cursor AI: Advanced SEC Filing Analysis Platform

## Executive Summary - Full Repo Coming Soon 

Cursor AI represents a paradigm shift in financial document analysis, leveraging advanced Language Learning Models (LLMs) and proprietary algorithms to transform complex SEC filings into actionable intelligence. Our system combines the reasoning capabilities of o1-mini with sophisticated natural language processing to detect patterns, discrepancies, and insights that traditional analysis methods might miss.

### Early Findings
Our initial analysis has revealed compelling insights:
- Significant number of companies showing minimal AI awareness in their filings
- Multiple instances of reporting discrepancies between different filing sections
- Varying levels of risk disclosure transparency
- Inconsistent financial reporting patterns across quarters
